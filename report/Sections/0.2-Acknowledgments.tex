I thank my internship tutor, Guillaume Dalle, for accepting having me as an intern and for introducing me to the research world, guiding and motivating me through the research process, and always showing himself available for answering my questions.

I also thank Zacharie Ales for accepting being my reference teacher for my PRE internship.
