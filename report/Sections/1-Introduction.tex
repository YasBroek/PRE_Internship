Start by motivating the study: why does it matter? Theoretical appeal + practical applications.
Then give a brief overview of the problem and solution approaches (to be extended in the lit review).
What is missing from previous papers? What is your novel angle?
Briefly describe your contributions.

Also describe the context of the internship: institution, tutoring, environment.
