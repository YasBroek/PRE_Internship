- Coding
    - Worked on code documentation
    - Parse data from solution
    - Modified instance structure
        - added variables
        - changed map from grid to graph
            - adapted the rest of the code
    - Started taking a look at Shortest Paths algorithms to work on tomorrow

- Paper reading
    - Revisited Decision-Focused Learning: Foundations, State of the Art,  Benchmark and Future Opportunities
        - Started reflecting on how to smooth a discrete function in our MAPF study

For tomorrow:
    - Work on understanding how to manipulate number of agents
    - implement independent shortest paths algorithm
    - try to materialize thoughts on how to smooth function for DFL application
