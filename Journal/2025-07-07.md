- Created TimeExpandedWeights struct for getting weights for TimeExpandedGraphs
    - Adapted functions for TimeExpandedGraphs
    - Adapted prioritized planning function
        - now path found is closer to gdalle's (256 vs 261)
- Ran tests on training
    - Found mistake in adapt_weights - corrected
    - Compared PP with learnt weights vs original instance - same costs apparently
