- Coding
    - Kept on working on parallelized_planning function
        - Tried a bunch of different approaches
        - Recognized some mistakes from yesterday's code and adapted
        - Still trying to make it run - it's taking really long
            - As it's taking too long, can't seem to use profiler (can't even run it once)
            - Debugged using strategic prints, and found out that what's taking so long is the addition of edges when creating a timed_graph (as it's a really big graph), but still haven't figured out an alternative to create it
    - Made some ajustements on training function
