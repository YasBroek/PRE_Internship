- Coding
    - Created TimeExpandedGraph struct
    - Implemented all basic graph methods required
    - Tested all methods with simple examples
    - Adapted prioritized_planning to use TimeExpandedGraph struct
        - Still working on it, stuck on reflecting on how I can run a_star with my new graph type
    - Updated data importation function so that diagonal moves are possible for agents with cost sqrt(2)
