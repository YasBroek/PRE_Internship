- Profiled prioritized_planning function
    - Apparently what takes the most time now is a_star, but it isn't red, so we're good
- Ran feasibility tests on prioritized_planning
    - Found a bug where at the last time steps some agents conflicted with the ones that'd already gotten to their goals cause they were trapped and had no other way
        - Developped a solution based on Buckley's start-and-goal-conflict heuristic
        - Got rid of the bug apparently
- Tested prioritized_planning on more than one map
    - Overall works well for map-sizes up to 32x32
        - Takes a long time for maps 64x64 depending on number of agents
        - Takes too long (and crashes) for map-sizes  >= 128x128
- Verified that y doesn't count fake moves after arrival 
    - Right now in training we're using independent-shortest-paths, which stops paths at agents' goals
- Started looking at documentation and examples for training libraries -> will start working on new training function tomorrow
