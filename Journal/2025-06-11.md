- Pipeline
    - Formalized a description of
        - the pipeline we want to use
        - what the statistical model looks like (architecture, features)
        - what the optimization problem looks like
        - what the training procedure looks like

- Coding
    - Studied CNNs and GNNs
    - Studied documentation on GraphNeuralNetworks.jl for possible implementation
    - Started thinking of code structure for Ï•_w fucntion
