- Coding
    - Added MultiAgentPathFinding to pkg and made comparisons to parallelized planning function
        - parallelized_planning gives worse result and takes more time - will keep working on it
    - Corrected training with linear regression
        - Now it's working and graphic makes sense
    - Ran multiple tests on training to make comparisons
        - numbers of epochs
        - alpha values
        - input data (if its varied or from same type of instance)
    - Implemented function to take learned weights and apply in order to find path
        - got a cost close to best solution from https://tracker.pathfinding.ai/
