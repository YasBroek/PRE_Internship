- Training from features
    - Keep results that were already genarated: Results from training with no conflicts
        - Table with costs according to the number of inputs for training and number of agents considered when testing
        - Cost vs number of agents graph
    - Generate
        - Scatter plot: Number of conflicts vs Cost
            - Run training function alternating conflict cost to get different models, and apply them on test instances
            - Get sum of costs and conflicts to plot
            - Use different color for each model
                - Blue for model trained with conflict cost = edge weight
                - Red for model trained with conflict cost = 1
                - Green for model trained with conflict cost = 10
                - ...
        - Line graph (3 axis): Cost and conflict evolution during training(cost vs epoch)
            - Two lines: Blue for path cost and Red for sum of conflicts
            - Collect data during the training process
- Training directly from map
    - Keep results that were already genarated: Results from training with no conflicts
        - Table of conflicts according to function used for Generalized Linear Model
        - Graphics of training evolution
            - Gradient of loss vs epoch
            - Loss vs epoch
            - Cost for a training instance vs epoch
            - Cost for a test instance vs epoch
        - Cost vs number of agents graph
        - Visualization for predicted edge weights (come up with a simpler scenario to facilitate visualization)
    - Generate same graphics as for training with features
