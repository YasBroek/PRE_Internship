- Meeting with Guillaume
    - What was discussed for coding:
        - Use MultiAgentPathfinding.jl's functions for faster data importation and training
        - Train using only 1 instance, with highest number of agents possible, and test with different scenarios with a same number of agents
        - Apply Projected Gradient Descent on training instead of softplus
        - In visualization, instead of mean we can try applying maximum edge weight to which a vertice is neighbor
    - I did everything that was discussed, next steps:
        - Study training function to see if changement to Guillaume's code is adequate (some things may still be missing, gotta take a look)
        - Find a way to deal with cooperative_astar problem (keep on getting error messages)
            - After dealt with, reimplement cost evolution on training
        - Get started on report
