- Tried out training function a bunch of times with ReLU and sigma but kept on getting error message
    - opened and issue on InferOpt's repo
        - Tried to simplify code for error message
- Tried switching from PerturbedMultiplicative to AdditivePerturbation to avoid error
    - For ReLU there's a problem where all wights convert to zero when applying model to a new instance after training
    - For sigma the loss graphic isn't as expected, and path cost after training is the same as without any training
