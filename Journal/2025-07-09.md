- training
    - Created new function for training using Flux.jl, InferOpt.jl and Zygote.jl
    - Tested initially using |Xw| and it's apparantly working, but results comparing to simply using PP were unsatisfying
    - Tried applying ReLU and sigma: Initially got error cause values reached 0.0
        - added small value (1e-6) to function
        - now graphics are a bit weird, and results are closer to simply using PP, but still higher
        - Will keep working on it tomorrow
