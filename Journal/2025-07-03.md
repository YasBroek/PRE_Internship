- Solved conflict dependency between new version of MultiAgentPathFinding and Makie
- Compared my code to MultiAgentPathFinding
    - Costs for independent shortest paths match
    - Costs for PP don't match, but my solution is feasible anyway (but MultiAgentPathFinding solution costs less)
- Ran tests on features functions
    - conflict_identifier OK
    - conflict_counter OK
    - harmonic_centrality OK
    - step_counter OK
    - distance_to_closest_obstacle OK
    - distance_to_closest_agent OK
    - distance_to_all_agents OK
    - number_of_agents_close OK
    - normalized_closeness_centrality OK
- wrote new functions to avoid constructing graph multiple times for the same map
- made some changes to struct and convert_to_my_struct
- studied and adapted training function so it could go faster
- working on understanding how to mesure actual loss
