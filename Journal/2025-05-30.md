- Read papers
    - ✅ A review of graph-based multi-agent pathfinding solvers: From classical to beyond classical, Gao et al. (2024)
    - ✅ Tracking Progress in Multi-Agent Path Finding
    - ✅ Cooperative Pathfinding
    - ✅ Decision-Focused Learning: Foundations, State of the Art, Benchmark and Future Opportunities
    - ✅ Learning a Priority Ordering for Prioritized Planning in Multi-Agent Path Finding, Zhang et al. (2022)
    - ✅ Guidance graph optimization for lifelong multi-agent path finding, Zhang et al. (2024)

    💡 Realized that maybe I was reading the articles too thoroughly, which was taking too long, starting to read mainly to get their main ideas and insights

- MAPF in Julia
    - ✅ Defined a struct to represent a MAPF problem instance
        - ❓ Have a question about the MAPF solution struct, will work on it on monday
    - ✅ Wrote a function to convert data from https://tracker.pathfinding.ai/ into my instance struct
    - ✅ Came up with a way to visualize the instance

Questions to remember on monday:
    - MAPF solution struct variables
    - Just to be sure, will we be working on classic MAPF ? (read an article that mentioned real-world problems)
