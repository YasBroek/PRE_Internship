- Revisited important papers and started thinking about materializing ideas into an algorithm (at the bottom of this journal)
- Finished reading material on Julia package development and started importing code from Pluto into VSCode. 
    - Created and activated package for code (MAPF_code), and added all packages necessary
    - Pasted code from pluto, and reorganized in multiple files
    - Started trying to work on optimization



- Initial idea for algorithm:
    - Import instance x
    - ? Calculate initially independent shortest paths
    - Calculate predicted weights (based on collisions)
    - perturb learned weights 
    - apply monte carlo
    - use parallelized planning
    - calculate solution
    - calculate loss -> compare with optimal value (which we already have)

- Algorithm:
    1   Input: x (Instance), y_optimum
    2   Initialize epsilon, M (number of perturbations), Z (noise distribution), n (learning rate)
    3   Function phi_w:
    4       theta = GNN(x)
    5       ym = []
    6       for m in 1:M:
    7           Zm ~ Z
    8           perturbed_theta <- theta + epsilon*Zm
    9           ym[m] <- parallelized_planning(x, perturbed_theta)
    10       end
    11      y_estimate <- sum(ym)/M
    12      F_epsilon <- (1/M) * sum([<y_m, θ + ε * Zm> for y_m in ym])
    13      loss <- F_epsilon + epsilon * Omega(y_optimum) - <theta, y_optimum>
    14      return loss, y_estimate
    15  end
    16
    17  apply SGD for updating model's parameters
