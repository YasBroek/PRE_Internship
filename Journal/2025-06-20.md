- Coding
    - Started testing with different instances: spotted more problems with prioritized_planning function
        - worked all day to solve them, but there are still some issues and I can't seem to find where the problem is, but it's still better than by the start of the day
    - Edited training function so that it trains from different instances at each layer - still haven't tested it
