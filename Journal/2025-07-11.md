- Meeting with Guillaume
- Adapted a_star for differently-weighted graphs - for now using zero heuristics, intend on switching to ISP
- Normalized features: now loss graphic is as expected for sigma
    - But path_cost is worse after applying model
- Got PerturbedMultiplicative from branch
- Added error to prioritized_planning to avoid crashing



- switch to vertex weights
represent as matrix 32x32 edge weights from vertex weights (not priority)

pick a scenario try out the highest number of agents with cooperativeastar train with that and after test with different scenarios for same number of agents

instead of avg visualize max or min weights in visualization
switch color scle to logatihmic
