- Meeting with Guillaume
- Adapted a_star for differently-weighted graphs - for now using zero heuristics, intend on switching to ISP
- Normalized features: now loss graphic is as expected for sigma
    - But path_cost is worse after applying model
- Got PerturbedMultiplicative from branch
- Added error to prioritized_planning to avoid crashing
