- Ran a lot of tests with new training function
    - results are on the images on report - still haven't changed the text


norm for gradient
explain exactly what I'm plotting for loss
early stopping
focus on results for test set
split training|validation|test
investigate training with PP by simplifying
    - try an instance where ISP x PP x optimal all behave differently
    - bring one of them to imitate optimal but not the other
try with different orderings
- just room several sizes
- room, random, maze, empty
use different agent quantities
use addtitive, multiplicative
epsilon up to 1
